      <p align="justify">I am a tech-savvy Xennial and have a passion for technology. I work as an Marketing Administrator in a real estate company as my day job. At night, I would attend tech workshops and events to enrich myself.<br/><br/>I get the taste of programming when I studied a module called C++ in Poly, which I've scored A for it. At work, I get to create microsites for different projects. I could only get to code them in HTML as CSS was being controlled. Hence, this has inspired me to learn coding. I hope by joining the bootcamp would be able to do a career switch.<br/><br/>During my free time, I like to create Do-It-Yourself projects and practising Yoga.</p>
